# Changelog

All notable changes to Tahhan Conflict Detective are documented here.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- All prefixes standardised to `tahcd_` / `TAHCD_`: constants, AJAX actions, nonce, meta keys, cookie, option keys, script handle, and JS data object — resolves WordPress.org prefix uniqueness requirement.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- Plugin renamed to **Tahhan Conflict Detective** (slug: `tahhan-conflict-detective`).
- Namespace changed from `PluginConflictDetector` to `TahhanConflictDetective`.
- Text domain changed from `conflict-detective` to `tahhan-conflict-detective`.
- Contributors updated to `mustafatahhan`.
- Debug log clear uses `WP_Filesystem::put_contents()` instead of `file_put_contents()`.

## 2.2.0 – 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Error log sort** — replaced lexicographic `strcmp()` with numeric `strtotime()` comparison so entries from WP `debug.log` and Apache `error_log` sort correctly together (#24).
- **UTC timestamps** — `current_time('mysql')` changed to `current_time('mysql', true)` in `Change_History::write()` and `Health_Scan::run()` so stored timestamps are always UTC, fixing incorrect confidence scores on non-UTC sites (#23).
- **Prepared SQL** — wrapped bare-string queries in `Health_Scan::get_last_scan()` and `get_likely_culprit()` with `$wpdb->prepare()`, eliminating PHPCS suppression comments (#22).
- **CI supply-chain** — pinned `10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy` from the mutable `@stable` tag to the immutable `@v2` major-version tag.

## [2.1.4] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Architecture: Safe Mode AJAX handler never registered** — `Safe_Mode::init()` was called via `add_action('plugins_loaded', ..., 1)` inside `Plugin::init()` which itself ran at priority 5. By then priority 1 had already fired, so `pcd_safe_mode_toggle` never existed and WordPress returned `-1`. Fixed by calling `Safe_Mode::init()` directly at file-load time (outside the Plugin class).
- **Architecture: Database::maybe_upgrade() never ran** — same root cause. Now registered at priority 0 at file-load time.

### Changed
- **Safe Mode tab UI fully redesigned**
  - Inactive state: a card with header, "Start Safe Mode" button, description text, and numbered how-to steps.
  - Active state: an amber banner (outside the card) showing the disabled-plugin count and a "Stop Safe Mode" button, followed by a card with the plugin toggle list and a disabled-count label.
- **JavaScript toggle handler** now uses delegated event binding (`$(document).on('click', '#pcd-toggle-safe-mode', ...)`) and reloads the page on success to reflect the server-side state change.
- Added `safeModeLoading` and `safeModeStop` localised strings for button feedback during AJAX calls.

### Added
- CSS for `.pcd-safe-mode-banner`, `.pcd-safe-mode-banner__body`, `.pcd-btn-stop`, `.pcd-safe-mode-steps`, and `.pcd-safe-mode-count`.
